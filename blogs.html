	   <h3> Can online degrees help you get a job? </h3>
            <p>This whole year and the previous one have been full of loaded changes for all of us, you and I have seen a lot of shifts happen in many industries of India and other countries, one of those many many industries is the education industry. Changes in the education industry have been both productive and deteriorated, whereas we’ve seen a major shift of the schools and college classes from offline to online, online degrees and courses have also emerged as quality learning while sitting in the safety of your home. According to recent studies, India has been proclaimed to be the second country to have the most enrollments in online degrees and courses with more than 155k students all over the country. This has been a revolution in the making? But the question remains, how will this make a difference in our future or our career which is yet to take flight?</p>
	    <p>Online education has its perks and downsides, let's face it, learning with just an electronic screen gets boring. You start feeling lonely without seeing your friends around like a normal classroom ambiance, it feels isolated. there is a lack of motivation in students because they feel like the class is just a couple of button presses away every day. Then we all have our fair share of technical issues whether they are legit or just excuses to get out of answering our teachers. Is the online education shift all about the positive viewpoints? Can the perks make up for these difficulties?</p>
	    <p>Online courses have proved to be an astounding boost since we get to learn our concepts from the best teachers locally or internationally, it has given us the flexibility to improve our skills not only conceptually but practically. Many students aspire to study and build their careers abroad, they spend thousands of dollars for admissions and residential aspects but with education online, they don’t need to spend thousands but all they can do is take online courses to bring that knowledge home.</p>

<p>Can online courses help land you a job? It's no surprise that while we would’ve been doing one thing at a time if the course was in an offline mode, which is one skill at a time. Online courses, as most of them, are fast-paced and can enhance your skill set quicker than any course offline. These courses tend to make a person workplace ready and with the opportunity to do internships in exceptional companies to start applying that skill set is not far. Which is one of the most important skills accessible from online courses?</p>

<p>The answer is Data Science, the jobs that of a data scientist are one of the highest paying jobs in India at the moment. One significant prerequisite in start learning data science is the ability to start learning things quickly. Most of the students wish to have a career in IT which is full of diversity, aside from Data Scientist jobs, we have web developers, software testers, engineers, and many more. Opportunities are endless with the shift to online education, undergraduate students have the chance to work with internships and fresher jobs provided by their colleges and different websites. Our future is in safe hands and with increased employment possibilities, it's gonna be a memorable revolution. So go on with your doing, you’re making history.</p>
