          <h3 class="post-title"> Hectic Classes and Reconsidering Decisions</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
        <p> Still updating this site, I have to take all my Classes.
              It has been really hectic with all the lectures, notes and network issues. I've been applying for internships since yesterday because 
          I realized all I've been doing is learning so I wanted to start to do some practical work now. God, it's hard, I feel like a 
          pessimist cause I think I'm incompetent for most of them, trying to ignore it though. While applying I feel like Iâ€™ve started to question what I am 
          doing or if I even love it. Started to reconsider a lot of things. I think the questions are inevitable but I might not like the answers 
          to them. ðŸ˜”

              <div class="post-content">
                <p> Creating a website has been on my agenda since forever,
                  especially after doing more and more courses and studying
                  with HTML and CSS </p>
                <p> Though I still have to do JavaScript, I found this great
             app Mimo, with its help I am halfway on building my website. Though i might not not update this site as much. </p>
