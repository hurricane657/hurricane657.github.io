          <h3 class="post-title"> Twitter homepage and Changing plans </h3>
          <div class="post-content">
        <p>I decided to make another homepage replica last night, was gonna start the work in the morning. As soon as I sat with my laptop, 
          studying the homepage of Twitter, noticed for the first time that it‚Äôs so gorgeous but had to cut that short. One of the internships
          reverted back, got so excited when I saw that ‚Äúin-touch‚Äù, it was one of the important ones too, they gave me an official task in order to
         get selected, i need to write a task blog on "can online courses get you a job?", hope this one‚Äôs good. ü§û</p>

          <h3 class="post-title"> Hectic Classes and Reconsidering Decisions</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
        <p> Still updating this site, I have to take all my Classes.
              It has been really hectic with all the lectures, notes and network issues. I've been applying for internships since yesterday because 
          I realized all I've been doing is learning so I wanted to start to do some practical work now. God, it's hard, I feel like a 
          pessimist cause I think I'm incompetent for most of them, trying to ignore it though. While applying I feel like I‚Äôve started to question what I am 
          doing or if I even love it. Started to reconsider a lot of things. I think the questions are inevitable but I might not like the answers 
          to them. üòî

              <h3 class="post-title"> Becoming a web developer</h3>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p> Creating a website has been on my agenda since forever,
                  especially after doing more and more courses and studying
                  with HTML and CSS </p>
                <p> Though I still have to do JavaScript, I found this great
             app Mimo, with its help I am halfway on building my website. Though i might not not update this site as much. </p>
